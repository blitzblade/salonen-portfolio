This is a simple porfolio website built using React. It serves as both a portfolio website explaining what I have done, and also as a code sample. It demonstrates that I have a knowledge of the following technologies:

<ul>
  <li>React and JSX</li>
  <li>React Router</li>
  <li>React Bootstrap></li>
  <li>ES6</li>
  <li>Props</li>
  <li>State</li>
  <li>Lifecycle methods</li>
  <li>HTTP calls</li>
  <li>Reading data from JSON</li>
</ul>

<h2>Starting the app on local machine</h2>
After cloning, do the following steps to start the app after cloning it.

(assuming NPM is installed on local machine)
<ol>
  <li>First, run <strong>npm install</strong></li>
  <li>Next, run <strong>npm start</strong></li>
  <li>The app will then run in port `localhost:3000` and will open a new browser tab</li>
</ol>
